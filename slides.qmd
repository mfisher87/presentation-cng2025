:::notes
I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager for GeoJupyter.

Before GeoJupyter, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects.
Maybe we've spoken on GitHub before!
_earthaccess_ is another community-owned project I help maintain, one of my favorites.
It enables access to NASA data in 3 lines of code;
a huge improvement: before _earthaccess_ you had to write >100 lines to authenticate and
interact with the NASA earth science data API.

:::notes
I have lots of stuff I want to talk to you all about!
I hope we can find each other later and chat :)

Also, if you want to check out these slides and follow the links, they are publicly
available online.

I'm not going to go through this slide now; I'll show it again at the end, so don't
worry if you didn't catch the URL.

:::notes
In this talk, I'm going to introduce the GeoJupyter community and discuss why it exists.
I'll then introduce and demo the JupyterGIS software.
Finally, we'll talk about how you can join the community.

These slides are available on the web at this URL, as well as on GitHub.
If you missed it, don't worry, I'll leave this slide up at the end.

:::notes
First, I'm representing a lot of folks today.
I don't own this, our community does.
I'd like the thank the many collaborators involved in this project.
So many people and organizations have come together to make this happen!

<!-- alex ignore special -->
Special thanks to QuantStack for leading the development of JupyterGIS, and ESA for
funding them.

And personal thanks to Fernando P√©rez and the Schmidt Center for Data Science &
Environment for hiring me and supporting me to work on this project!

I'd like to spend time individually thanking on everyone, but then my time
would be over :)

Finally, thanks to all the amazing role models in these communities who have inspired me
to be a better community manager and developer.

**Thank you all.**

## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

<br />
<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} to enable **more people to
confidently engage with geospatial data**.

<hr />

What is GeoJupyter?

## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
It's important to us to create tools that combine the strengths of many amazing existing
tools.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.
:::


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.

**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** what many
think of as "GIS".

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is far from limited to JupyterGIS; not everything we build is going to be a
huge project.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

:::notes
These are only a few examples we've heard from geospatial practitioners;
we're not actively solving all of these problems right now, but we might give it a try eventually!

:::notes
The landscape of open source geospatial tools is far from perfect.

What we are attempting to bring to the table is a holistic approach to evaluating and
improving this landscape.
To achieve this, we're taking a human-centric approach to finding and addressing these
gaps.
So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

The _GeoJupyter_ flagship project...
:::


## What is it? How is it different?

:::incremental
* Interactive GIS environment
* JupyterLab-native (try it in a JupyterHub!)
* Python API
* Supports QGIS project files
* **_Real-time collaboration_**: like Google Docs, but on a map!
:::


## Demo

* GIS environment features: layers, identify, time slider
* Collab features: Nick assist?
* :woman_dancing: _The GIS Bounce_ :man_dancing: in JGIS


## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
There are lots of avenues for supporting this work.

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

We also have a community chat on Zulip, which is like an open-source Slack.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents, and we're
jazzed to hear what you think :)

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.
We still don't know what this will look like, and while GeoJupyter will always be
community owned, we're ready to work with folks whose goals align with ours.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
