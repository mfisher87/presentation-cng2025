:::notes
I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager for GeoJupyter.

Before GeoJupyter, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've spoken on GitHub before!
_earthaccess_ is one of my favorite community-owned project I help maintain.
It enables access to NASA data in 3 lines of code;
a huge improvement: before _earthaccess_ you had to write >100 lines to authenticate and
interact with the NASA earth science data API.

I also love dogs (if you see one, let me know :grin:), gardening, and amateurishly playing music on drums and keyboards :smile:

:::notes
But first, I'm representing a lot of folks today.
I don't own this, our community does.
I'd like the thank the many collaborators involved in this project.
**So many** people and organizations have come together to make this happen!

<!-- alex ignore special -->
Special thanks to QuantStack for leading the development of JupyterGIS, and ESA for
funding them.

And personal thanks to Fernando P√©rez and the Schmidt Center for Data Science &
Environment for supporting me to work on this project!

I'd like to spend time individually thanking everyone, but then my time would
be over :smile:

One last thanks to all the amazing role models in these communities who have inspired me
to be a better community manager and developer.

**Thank you all.**

## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

<br />
<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} to enable **more people to
confidently engage with geospatial data**.

<hr />
:::

:::notes
What is GeoJupyter?

_Read the slide_

**Jupyter** is a very mature community with millions of users that has already
made huge strides in making programming more accessible to the world. and
It also provides a powerful architecture for interactive and real-time collaborative
development, which is why we're building on top of it.

Our mission is intentionally really broad.
What does it look like to you to **enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data**?

We want to hear from you, and I'll share how you can do that at the end.
:::


## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:open_hands: **Open source** - geospatial data is important to everyone!

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
Open source is a critical value for us; we want to **democratize** geospatial
data practice, so everything we do is free and open.

And it's important to us to create tools that combine the strengths of many
amazing existing tools.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.

![You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values belong together!

But it's not going to happen by accident, like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups commercial :smile:
**Lots** of work needs to be done!
:::


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** what many
think of as "GIS".

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is far from limited to JupyterGIS; not everything we build is going to be a
huge project or GIS-first.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter()
```

:::notes
Why are we doing this?

Because geospatial is hard.

What we're bringing to the table is a holistic and human-centered approach to
evaluating and improving this landscape.

So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

The following are only a few examples of challenges we've heard from those geospatial
practitioners.
Many of these challenges have existing solutions, but they often involve
cobbling together multiple tools, introducing workflow friction.

Geospatial is hard, **even for experts**.

We **all** struggle sometimes.

## Brianna's story

[_When our community burned, where was the satellite information?_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-our-community-burned-where-satellite-information-pag%C3%A1n-phd-8rxwf/?trackingId=goJI9VniOZAI3RGuoPXysA%3D%3D)

-- Brianna Pag√°n, Technical Program Lead @ Development Seed, ex-NASA Deputy DAAC Manager

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, who you may have heard speak yesterday, lost her home in the recent fires in California.
When this happened, she was away from home.
Her first thought, like a true geospatial nerd, was to look at the data.
Recounting these events, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. [‚Ä¶] and yet the irony is
> that with all my experience I could not access the information I knew existed to help
> our community.

End-quote. You can read Brianna's full story by following the link at the top of the slide.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(1)
```

:::notes
Another pain point we hear is that folks want to visualize the same data in
different ways, and have those visualizations interactively linked.
:::


## Linked visualizations

![](/assets/images/jgis-linked-viz.jpg)

:::notes
For example, you might want to visualize soil samples on the map, but also
scatter plot those soil samples to find relationships between those samples'
attributes.

You may find spatial correlations you wouldn't have otherwise noticed by
interacting with variable correlations, and following those correlations back
to the map.

There's a package called "glue" that can do this, and it'd be really cool to
integrate that functionality with a GIS-first interface.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(2)
```

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing from a programming environment, like a Jupyter Notebook.

The process users described has many repeated steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".
:::

:::{.column width=65%}
:abacus: Do some analysis

:floppy_disk: Write out a data file

:::notes
First, do some analysis. Then, write out a data file.
If you're working in a cloud environment, download it.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, load up a basemap, and then finally load your data.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time a practitioner does a
critical task: checking their work.

Checking our work shouldn't be frustrating and time-consuming, it should be
seamless, joyful, and rewarding.

So we developed an interface for this in JupyterGIS, a function called `explore()`.
It's still rough around the edges, but it's available now! :tada:

It enables the user to pass a data structure directly to a visualization
environment with **one line of code**.

We'll show more shortly!

## Demo

:bulb: Lite: <https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/>

:test_tube: Lab: <http://34.71.209.73:8888/>

:::notes
_Open in private window:_
<http://34.71.209.73:8888/>

First, let's look at "The GIS Bounce" we talked about earlier.

* _Open `explore.jgis`._
  * This notebook explores a dataset about the discrimatory practice of
    "redlining", in which a government agency graded neighborhoods to
    financially exclude people on the basis of race.
* _Run the notebook cell by cell, except the final cell_
  * We've got some data and we want to validate it.
  * Calling `.plot()` doesn't get us very far; it would be challenging to verify the data is properly geolocated without a basemap.
  * We would need to write more code to inspect the features' attributes.
  * That's where the `explore()` function comes in!
  * We can write only one line of code, excluding imports, to interact with this data much like we would in QGIS.
* _Run final cell. Right click the "New Haven" layer, zoom to it._
  * The geolocation looks good.
  * Let's inspect the features and be sure those look the way we expect, too.
  <!-- alex ignore white -->
  * We can see that this neighborhood was ranked "A" ("best") because it was
    mostly white, meaning that home loans were more readily available,
    leading to generational harm.
  * Now we can go back to our example analysis.
    We could close this panel and re-open it again later.
  * Or, because this visualizer is in a JupyterLab window, we can move it
    around and scale it however we like, leaving it available for more
    visualization later.
* _Move the window to a bottom pane and scale it way down._

Let's explore some example JupyterGIS projects.

* _Open `france_hiking.jGIS` from JupyterLab file explorer._
  * This example JupyterGIS project file and many more are distributed with
    JupyterGIS, and you can check it out in your browser with JupyterLite from
    the "Try it now!" link in our README and docs.
  * This map shows hiking trails in France.
  * It's a bit noisy right now, so let's get rid of this MODIS layer.
* _Right click NAGAGIBS layer, remove._
  * Let's add a layer that shows where Strava users are running.
* _Open the layer browser._
  * Our layer browser has a bunch of pre-defined layers you can add to your map
* _Add "Strava.Run"._
  * The hiking layer is a bit hard to read now, though, so let's change the layer order.
* _Move "Strava.Run" underneath "Waymarked"._
  * Still a bit hard to read, let's change the opacity.
* _Set opacity of "Waymarked" to 1._

Let's change it up and look at some earthquakes data.

<!-- alex ignore color -->
* _Click `+`, "Add Vector Layer", "Add GeoJSON Layer"._
* Browse; select `eq.json`.
* Zoom way out.
* Activate the identify tool.
  * We have an "identify" tool that enables you to view attributes of these features.
* _Select a feature._
  * We can see the earthquake's magnitude and timestamp. It'd be nice to visualize this.
* _Open symbology for earthquakes._
  * Let's set the symbology to "graduated" and select the attribute we want to symbologize on.
  * We want to use color to represent the magnitude, and use a quantile scale.
* _Click "classify"._
  * Now, I want to view this data over time.
* _Open the time slider. Select the feature "Time" to use as time._
  * Let's select a time step of "daily".
* _Scrub with slider._
  * And let's animate it at 10 FPS.
* _Select 10FPS, press play._
  * Someone mentioned the other day that it would be cool to persist the past
    points when animating to see accumulation. Love that idea.

_Collaborative demo:_

* Nick: Disable the hiking and running layers
* Nick: Add `WaymarkedTrails.Slopes` layer
* Nick: Add an annotation at the base of a trail "Let's meet here at **Aerial Tram** on Friday"
* Matt: Looks someone's trying to collaborate with me! Who's that?
* Nick: Raise hand!
<!-- alex ignore he-she -->
* Matt: That's Nick Gondek, my co-worker. Looks like he's having trouble focusing on
  my talk and looking forward to some skiing :)
* Matt: **Follow Nick**.
* Matt: Respond to annotation: "Sounds awesome! Meet you there."
* Nick: Add another annotation for a run from the top of **Aerial Tram**, let's
  take **Chip's run** down to the hotel.
* Matt: Respond to annotation: Rad!
