:::notes
I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager for GeoJupyter.

Before GeoJupyter, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects.
Maybe we've spoken on GitHub before!
_earthaccess_ is another community-owned project I help maintain.
It's one of my favorites.
It enables access to NASA data in 3 lines of code;
a huge improvement: before _earthaccess_ you had to write >100 lines to authenticate and
interact with the NASA earth science data API.

I also love dogs (if you see one, let me know :grin:), gardening, and amateurishly playing music on drums and keyboards :smile:

First, I'm representing a lot of folks today.
I don't own this, our community does.
I'd like the thank the many collaborators involved in this project.
So many people and organizations have come together to make this happen!

<!-- alex ignore special -->
Special thanks to QuantStack for leading the development of JupyterGIS, and ESA for
funding them.

And personal thanks to Fernando P√©rez and the Schmidt Center for Data Science &
Environment for hiring me and supporting me to work on this project!

I'd like to spend time individually thanking on everyone, but then my time
would be over :smile:

## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

<br />
<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} to enable **more people to
confidently engage with geospatial data**.

<hr />
:::

:::notes
What is GeoJupyter?

_Read the slide_

Our mission is intentionally really broad.
What does it look like to you to **enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data**?

We want to hear from you, and I'll share how you can do that at the end.
:::


## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
It's important to us to create tools that combine the strengths of many amazing existing
tools.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.

These values belong together!

But it's not going to happen by accident, like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups commercial :smile:
:::


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.

**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** what many
think of as "GIS".

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is far from limited to JupyterGIS; not everything we build is going to be a
huge project.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter()
```

:::notes
Why are we doing this?

Because geospatial is hard.

What we are attempting to bring to the table is a holistic approach to evaluating and
improving this landscape.
To achieve this, we're taking a human-centric approach to finding and addressing these
gaps.
So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

These are only a few examples of challenges we've heard from geospatial practitioners.

Geospatial is hard, even for experts.

We all struggle sometimes.

-- Brianna Pag√°n, Technical Program Lead @ Development Seed, ex-NASA Deputy DAAC Manager

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, who you may have heard speak yesterday, lost her home in the recent fires in California.
When this happened, she was away from home.
Her first thought, like a true geospatial nerd, was to look at the data.
In the story linked on this slide, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. [‚Ä¶] and yet the irony is
> that with all my experience I could not access the information I knew existed to help
> our community.

End-quote. You can read Brianna's full story by following the link at the top of the slide.

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing from a programming environment, like a Jupyter Notebook.

The process users described has many repeated steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".

:::notes
First, do some analysis. Then, write out a data file. Download it.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, and open your data alongside a basemap.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time a practitioner does a
critical task: checking their work. It doesn't have to be this way!

Checking your work should be seamless and joyful.

So we developed an API for this, the `explore()` function.
It's currently a work in progress, but it enables the user to pass a data structure directly to a visualization environment.
We'll show more shortly!

# JupyterGIS {.nostretch}

:bangbang: Early development :bangbang:

![](/assets/images/logo-quantstack.png){width=50%}


:::notes
Let's talk about some of the work in progress now!

JupyterGIS is the _GeoJupyter_ flagship project, with development led by the amazing folks at QuantStack.
:::


## What is it? How is it different?

:::incremental
* Interactive GIS environment
* JupyterLab-native (try it in a JupyterHub!)
* Python API
* Supports QGIS project files
* Coming soon: STAC browser!
* **_Real-time collaboration_**: like Google Docs, but on a map!
:::

:::notes
_Read the slide_

**Jupyter** has made programming more accessible to the world, and provides a
powerful base for interactive and real-time collaborative development environments, which
is why we chose to build this as a JupyterLab extension.
:::


## Demo

<https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/>

_TODO: Link to infra_

* GIS environment features: layers, identify, time slider
* :woman_dancing: _The GIS Bounce_ :man_dancing: in JGIS
* Collab features: Nick assist?

:::notes
_Open in private window:_
<https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/>

* _Open `france_hiking.jGIS` from JupyterLab file explorer._
  * This map shows hiking trails in France.
  * Let's add a layer that shows where Strava users are running.
* _Open the layer browser._
  * Our layer browser has some pre-defined layers you can add to your map
* _Add "Strava.Run"._
  * The hiking layer is a bit hard to read now, though, so let's change the layer order.
* _Move "Strava.Run" underneath "Waymarked"._
  * Still a bit hard to read, let's change the opacity.
* _Set opacity of "Waymarked" to 1._

Let's look at some earthquakes data.

<!-- alex ignore color -->
* _Open "earthquakes.jgis"._
  * We have an "identify" tool that enables you to view attributes of these features.
* _Select a feature._
  * We can see the earthquake's magnitude and timestamp. It'd be nice to visualize this.
* _Open symbology for earthquakes._
  * Let's set the symbology to "graduated" and select the attribute we want to symbologize on.
  * We want to use color to represent the magnitude, and use a quantile scale.
* _Click "classify"._
  * Now, I want to view this data over time.
* _Open the time slider. Select the feature "Time" to use as time._
  * Let's select a time step of "daily".
* _Scrub with slider._
  * And let's animate it at 10 FPS.
* _Select 10FPS, press play._

Now, let's look at "The GIS Bounce".

* _Open `explore.jgis`._
* _Run the notebook cell by cell, except the final cell_
  * We've got some data and we want to validate it.
  * Calling `.plot()` doesn't get us very far; it would be challenging to verify the data is properly geolocated without a basemap.
  * We would need to write more code to inspect the features' attributes.
  * That's where the `explore()` function comes in!
  * We can write only one line of code, excluding imports, to interact with this data much like we would in QGIS.
* _Run final cell. Right click the "New Haven" layer, zoom to it._
  * The geolocation looks good.
  * Let's inspect the features and be sure those look the way we expect, too.
  * Looks good!
  * Now we can go back to our analysis. We can close it and re-open it again later.
  * Or, because this visualizer is in a JupyterLab window, we can move it around and scale it however we like.

Looks like someone is trying to collaborate with me right now...

* TODO: Collaboration demo here

## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

We also have a community chat on Zulip, which is like an open-source Slack.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents, and we're
jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.
We are still exploring what this will look like, and while GeoJupyter will
always be community owned, we're ready to work with folks whose goals align
with ours.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
