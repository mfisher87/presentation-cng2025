## :question: What is GeoJupyter? {.smaller}

<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-driven effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} for education, research, and industry.

We aim to combine the **approachability** and **playfulness** of desktop GIS tools, the
**flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding-driven GIS methods, and the **collaborative** and
**storytelling** power of Jupyter to enable more researchers, educators, and learners to
confidently engage with geospatial data.

## :people_holding_hands: A communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.

**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** GIS.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project; a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is far from limited to JupyterGIS; not everything we build is going to be a
huge project.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

:face_with_head_bandage: Existing workflows have some painful gaps:

* Even experts often struggle
* Friction when visualizing from a programming environment
* Linked visualizations are difficult to build
* Lack of tools for visualizing vertical landscapes
* Repeatable GIS layouts and symbology

:::notes
These are only a few examples we've heard from geospatial practitioners;
we're not actively solving all of these problems right now, but we might give it a try eventually!

:::notes
The landscape of open source geospatial tools is far from perfect.

What we are attempting to bring to the table is a holistic approach to evaluating and
improving this landscape.
To achieve this, we're taking a human-centric approach to finding and addressing these
gaps.
So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

# JupyterGIS

:bangbang: Early development :bangbang:

:::notes
The _GeoJupyter_ flagship project...
:::


## What is it? How is it different?

:::incremental
* Interactive GIS environment
* JupyterLab-native (try it in a JupyterHub!)
* Python API
* Supports QGIS project files
* **_Real-time collaboration!_**
:::


## Demo

* GIS environment features: layers, identify, time slider
* Collab features: Nick assist?
* :woman_dancing: _The GIS Bounce_ :man_dancing: in JGIS


## How you can help

* :studio_microphone: [Sign up for an interview](https://geojupyter.org/interviews/sign-up)!
* :test_tube: [Try JupyterGIS!](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/) Where does it meet your needs? Where does it fall short?
* :memo: [Report bugs, request features!](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues)
* :gift: [Open Pull Requests!](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis)
