## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and collaborative community-driven effort to [reimagine geospatial
interactive computing]{.jupyter-orange} experiences for education, research, and industry.

We aim to combine the **approachability** and **playfulness** of desktop GIS tools, the
**flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding-driven GIS methods, and the **collaborative** and
**storytelling** power of Jupyter to enable more researchers, educators, and learners to
confidently engage with geospatial data.

## :people_holding_hands: A communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.
**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** GIS.
**JupyterGIS** is a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.
