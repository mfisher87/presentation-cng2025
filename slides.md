:::notes
I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager for GeoJupyter.

Before GeoJupyter, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects.
Maybe we've spoken on GitHub before!
_earthaccess_ is another community-owned project I help maintain, one of my favorites.
It enables access to NASA data in 3 lines of code;
a huge improvement: before _earthaccess_ you had to write >100 lines to authenticate and
interact with the NASA earth science data API.

:::notes
I have lots of stuff I want to talk to you all about!
I hope we can find each other later and chat :)

Also, if you want to check out these slides and follow the links, they are publicly
available online.

I'm not going to go through this slide now; I'll show it again at the end, so don't
worry if you didn't catch the URL.

:::notes
In this talk, I'm going to introduce the GeoJupyter community and discuss why it exists.
I'll then introduce and demo the JupyterGIS software.
Finally, we'll talk about how you can join the community.

These slides are available on the web at this URL, as well as on GitHub.
If you missed it, don't worry, I'll leave this slide up at the end.

## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

<br />
<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-driven effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} to enable **more people to
confidently engage with geospatial data**.

<hr />

## Our values

<br />

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

<br />

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

<br />

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.

**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** GIS.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project; a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is far from limited to JupyterGIS; not everything we build is going to be a
huge project.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

:face_with_head_bandage: Existing workflows have some painful gaps:

* Even experts often struggle
* Friction when visualizing from a programming environment
* Linked visualizations are difficult to build
* Lack of tools for visualizing vertical landscapes
* Repeatable GIS layouts and symbology

:::notes
These are only a few examples we've heard from geospatial practitioners;
we're not actively solving all of these problems right now, but we might give it a try eventually!

:::notes
The landscape of open source geospatial tools is far from perfect.

What we are attempting to bring to the table is a holistic approach to evaluating and
improving this landscape.
To achieve this, we're taking a human-centric approach to finding and addressing these
gaps.
So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.
