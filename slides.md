## :question: What is GeoJupyter? {.smaller}

<br />

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-driven effort to [reimagine geospatial interactive
computing experiences]{.jupyter-orange} for education, research, and industry.

We aim to combine the **approachability** and **playfulness** of desktop GIS tools, the
**flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding-driven GIS methods, and the **collaborative** and
**storytelling** power of Jupyter to enable more researchers, educators, and learners to
confidently engage with geospatial data.

## :people_holding_hands: A communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
A common point of confusion is the name GeoJupyter vs JupyterGIS.
**GeoJupyter** is a community; our interest includes but **is not limited to** GIS.
**JupyterGIS** is a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in some similar ways to QGIS.
We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

:face_with_head_bandage: Existing workflows have some painful gaps:

* Friction when visualizing from a programming environment
* Linked visualizations are difficult to build
* Lack of tools for visualizing vertical landscapes
* Repeatable GIS layouts and symbology

:::notes
These are only a few examples we've heard from geospatial practitioners;
we're not actively solving all of these problems right now, but we might give it a try eventually!

::::::columns
:::{.column width=50%}
* Do some analysis
* Write out a data file
* Download it to local machine
* Open QGIS, load basemap, load data file

# JupyterGIS

:bangbang: Early development :bangbang:

:::notes
The _GeoJupyter_ flagship project...
:::


## What is it? How is it different?

:::incremental
* Interactive GIS environment
* JupyterLab-native (try it in a JupyterHub!)
* Python API
* Supports QGIS project files
* **_Real-time collaboration!_**
:::


## Demo

* GIS environment features: layers, identify, time slider
* Collab features: Nick assist?
* :woman_dancing: _The GIS Bounce_ :man_dancing: in JGIS


## How you can help

* :test_tube: Try JupyterGIS! Where does it meet your needs? Where does it fall short?
* :memo: Report bugs, request features!
* :gift: Open Pull Requests!
* :ballot_box: Help develop and operate community governance and scaffolding!
* :sunglasses: Contribute awesome vibes to our community!
